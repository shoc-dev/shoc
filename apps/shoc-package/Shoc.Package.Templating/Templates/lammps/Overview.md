### Overview.md

The **LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator) Template** provides a foundation for running molecular dynamics simulations.It allows users to specify key container properties like the base image, user identification, and the essential entrypoint command for starting simulations efficiently.

#### Key Features
- **Configurable Base Image**: Specify the tag for the underlying base image to suit various LAMMPS versions or dependencies.
- **Customizable User Identity**: Define the user ID and username for processes within the container, enhancing security and control.
- **Defined Entrypoint**: Clearly set the primary command or script that executes when the container is launched.
